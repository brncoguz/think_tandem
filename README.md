# ThinkTandem
ThinkTandem is a Flutter-based AI assistant designed to enhance critical thinking skills rather than simply providing answers. Unlike conventional AI assistants that focus on delivering direct solutions, ThinkTandem is built to develop users' cognitive abilities through guided collaboration and intentional scaffolding.
